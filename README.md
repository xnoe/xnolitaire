# Xnolitaire

A portmanteau of xnoe and solitaire, because I'm bad at naming things.

Greetings! This is a very bad and mobile-unfriendly Klondike implementation that makes use of HTML5's built in drag-and-drop functionality rather than canvas or JS positioning because sites that did that didn't perform well on my laptop for whatever reason.

It's fairly extensible in terms of what cards are in the game, but as for changing game rules, unfortunately they're mostly hardcoded.

In its default configuration, it has 8 suits rather than 4, 4 colours rather than 2, and a tableau that is 9 wide. I personally find it more fun than having only a standard deck of cards.

My aim with this was to write a solitaire making use of solely JS and HTML features with no external libraries, and I think I succeeded. This was written solely for my own enjoyment, not as something for others to use, but I feel that someone more qualified at programming than me may be able to make good use of the codebase, should they desire.

PRs are welcome is anyone is insane/bored enought to contribute to this mess.
